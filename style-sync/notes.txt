So far we have built out a 
- onboarding flow
    with:
    username
    bio
    style preferences
    Interest fields
    Shop user integration
    token generation


- DB integration
    - Supabase client is configured in src/lib/supabase.ts
    - Profile data saves to userprofiles table
    - The connection works (But no edge functions are used but we can do this later)
    
- Navigation system
- app checks if user has profile(how is this done?)
- shows the onboading page(basic) for new userprofiles
- Then shows main app which is nothing but will be converted into our style sync page.
- Navigation is quick. 


Assumptions:
    - We are okay with working on local host as rn we can't run on shop app. Which is fine until we have working prototype plus local hosts gives us console access
    - So we will have manual john does. And No userId just a temp_random number as the UUID. 
Next Steps:
    - add interests column to the DB
