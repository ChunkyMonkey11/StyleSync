**@steve @david** Hey Steve and David! 👋 Hope you're both doing well!

I'm hitting a wall with my StyleSync Shop Mini and could use some guidance. The Mini renders perfectly in localhost but completely fails to load in the actual Shop App environment.

## 🔍 **Issue Summary**
• ✅ **Browser** (`localhost:5173`): Mini loads and functions correctly  
• ❌ **Shop App** (iOS Simulator + Physical Device): White screen, no content  
• ❌ **Xcode "Apps and Devices Inspection"**: Shows "No inspectable contents"

## 🛠️ **What I've Tried**

### **Dependencies & Configuration**
• ✅ Verified `@shopify/shop-minis-react` version compatibility (0.2.0)  
• ✅ Added missing `vite.config.mjs` with proper optimization  
• ✅ Fixed CSS imports order (Tailwind + Shop Minis styles)  
• ✅ Updated `manifest.json` with required fields

### **Authentication & Edge Functions**
• ✅ Migrated from direct Supabase calls to Edge Functions (following your Supabase guide)  
• ✅ Created `useAuth` hook for JWT token management  
• ✅ Deployed `auth`, `check-profile`, and `create-profile` Edge Functions  
• ✅ Updated Supabase secrets with correct API keys  
• ✅ Fixed 401 authentication errors

### **Build & Development Setup**
• ✅ Verified TypeScript configuration  
• ✅ Confirmed all required dependencies are installed  
• ✅ Tested both iOS Simulator (`npm start` → press `i`) and QR code scanning  
• ✅ Checked network accessibility and port configuration

### **Debugging Attempts**
• ✅ Created minimal test App.tsx (red screen) - still didn't render in Shop environment  
• ✅ Verified Shop App is running and accessible on simulator  
• ✅ Checked for import errors and syntax issues  
• ✅ Confirmed no localStorage usage (Shop Minis compliant)

## 📋 **Current Setup**
• **SDK Version**: `@shopify/shop-minis-react@0.2.0`  
• **CLI Version**: `@shopify/shop-minis-cli@0.0.197`  
• **Architecture**: Edge Functions + JWT authentication  
• **Environment**: iOS Simulator (iOS 18.6) + Physical iPhone

## 🤔 **Key Question**
The fact that the Mini works perfectly in browser but fails completely in Shop App suggests an environment-specific issue rather than a code problem. Could this be related to:
• Shop App not properly recognizing/loading the Mini?  
• Missing development configuration in Shop App?  
• Version compatibility issues with the newer SDK?

## 🔧 **Next Steps**
Planning to run `npx shop-minis doctor` to see if it catches any configuration issues we might have missed. Any other diagnostic steps or specific areas you'd recommend investigating?

The Edge Functions integration is working great - just need to get the Mini actually loading in the Shop environment! 🙏
