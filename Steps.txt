1. Lets work on the page that appears when a user first joins the mini.
So our first time login page.
I am looking to gather this information to create a user profile.

User:
    - Username : How people search for friends. (Unique)
    - SyncId : Internal UUID that we use to track all users. (Can be used for future use or admin dashboard idk yet)
    - Bio   : User Bio for their self
    - Pfp : Just for places where PFP can be used
    - Metadata :  Addtional info that the shop sdk will give us about the users.
    - Interest : Take user interest: Note for form ("In the form similar to how in linkdin u can add skills that turn into bubbles make sure the form does the same")

Try to see if it possible to encorporate:
- useBuyerAttributes
- useCurrentUser

First impelemtation:
- Build a simple page that doesnt store the info anywhere. 
- Just has a form that takes in whatever user inputs specified above

1."Sync" Mechanics:
When two users sync, do they see each other's feeds in real-time?
    Yes: But in a sense of like a profile is created and now I can kinda click into their feed. This could be creative like mini islands like animal crossing, or a customizable closet that repersetns a persons feed.
Is syncing mutual (both approve) or one-way following?
    Mutual
Can you have different levels (close friends vs casual follows)?
    Not for now.


2. Feed Content:
What shows up in a friend's feed? Their:
Recent browsing?
    Yes but in a sense of every friend has their feed curated using the hooks at the start hence our login page. 

Saved/favorited items?
    Yes
Actual purchases?
    Yes
Posts/reviews they make?
Yes

3. Privacy Controls:
Can users control what's visible to synced friends?
    Not for now
Hide certain shops/categories?
    No
Private browsing mode?
    What do you mean by this??

4.Current State:
You've built the onboarding - is that storing data to Supabase?
    No after we disuss what info we should collect at onboarding and how we should create our intial user profiel we can do this.
Do you have the "invite/sync" functionality yet?
    No
Is the feed system started or is that next?
    No - First we want to create a good user profile and db system.


5.Technical:
Are you building this entirely within Shop's Mini SDK constraints?
    Preffered this way. But open to wrtiing custom logic. 
Supabase as your backend - any Shop API integrations needed?
    Not sure
Real-time updates or pull-to-refresh model?
    Pull to refresh.
