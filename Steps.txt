1. Lets work on the page that appears when a user first joins the mini.
So our first time login page.
I am looking to gather this information to create a user profile.

User:
    - Username : How people search for friends. (Unique)
    - SyncId : Internal UUID that we use to track all users. (Can be used for future use or admin dashboard idk yet)
    - Bio   : User Bio for their self
    - Pfp : Just for places where PFP can be used
    - Metadata :  Addtional info that the shop sdk will give us about the users.
    - Interest : Take user interest: Note for form ("In the form similar to how in linkdin u can add skills that turn into bubbles make sure the form does the same")

Try to see if it possible to encorporate:
- useBuyerAttributes
- useCurrentUser

First impelemtation:
- Build a simple page that doesnt store the info anywhere. 
- Just has a form that takes in whatever user inputs specified above
