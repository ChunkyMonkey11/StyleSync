## 📝 Best Practices

When creating planning docs:
1. **Be specific** - Clear requirements, not vague ideas
2. **Include context** - Explain the "why" not just the "what"
3. **Update PROJECT_NOTES.md** - Keep the source of truth current
4. **Date your decisions** - Track when choices were made
5. **Link to related docs** - Connect planning to implementation
