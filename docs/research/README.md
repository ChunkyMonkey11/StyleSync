## 📝 Research Best Practices

When adding research:
1. **Include methodology** - How was data collected?
2. **Date findings** - Research gets stale
3. **Show raw + insights** - Both data and interpretation
4. **Link to decisions** - How did this inform the product?
5. **Make it actionable** - What should we do with this?
